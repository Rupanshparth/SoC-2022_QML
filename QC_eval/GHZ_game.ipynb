    "Let's reconstruct the quesiton in the following way.\n",
    "First, instead of the referee giving 0 or 1 bits to the players he gives the letters X or Y.\n",
    "And the players instead of returning the bits 0 and 1 will return the numbers +1 and -1.\n",
    "Then the players will win the game when one of the below conditions is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    " $$Xa*Xb*Xc = 1$$\n",
    " $$Xa*Yb*Yc = -1$$\n",
    " $$Xb*Ya*Yc = -1$$\n",
    " $$Xc*Yb*Ya = -1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On multiplying the above equations we get \n",
    "$$(Xa)^2(Xb)^2(Xc)^2(Ya)^2(Yb)^2(Yc)^2 = -1$$\n",

    "Which is a contradiction, so it is impossible to have a chance of winning all the time.\n",
    "But we can still find strategies in which the chance of winning is highest. One strategy is given below.\n",
    "- player A gives +1 as the output irrespective of the letter he recieves.\n",
    "- player B and C give the output +1 and -1 for inputs X and Y respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar strategies or otherwise simply assigning fixed return values to different players so that the output is -1 will atmost allow the players to win 75 percent of the time."
