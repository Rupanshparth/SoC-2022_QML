###### Basics of Quantum Mechanics######

We went through the basics of quantum mechanics using the notation of linear algebra. Studied the unitary time evolution under the Hamiltonion. Learnt about the Hermitan operators and importance of their eigenvlaues and eigenvectors. Learnt about the effects of measurement on Quantum systems. Also understood the idea of measurement in terms of projection operators.

###### Quantum Circuits######

- We started with the fundamental concept of quantum computation and quantum information, the quantum bit. 
- We then studied the basic single qubit gates like identity gates, pauli gates, hadamard transform and rotations.
- We then studied that any one qubit gate can be built using just rotation gates.
- Studied the C-NOT gate and understood the proof of how any multiple qubit logic gate maybe composed from CNOT and single qubit gates.
- Studied the no-cloning theroem.
- Understood the technique of Quantum teleportaion.
- Prepared Bell gates in Qiskit and extended it to construct GHZ gate.
- Constructed basic gates like swap gate and incrementation mod 8 gate.
